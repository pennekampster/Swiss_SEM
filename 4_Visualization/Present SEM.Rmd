# Exercice

We have now analysed the model. 

How would you draw the model output to represent the minimum information required in order to reproduce this model?

<!-- Alternative wording could be "How would you draw the model output for a manuscript"? That might create more variation which would be kind of fun-->

\begin{center}
Draw your idea

<!-- We chose this figure because it is a very simple illustration of a latent variable. The purpose of this study was to test whether the latent concept of "learning engagement" could be measured in a lab environment. The authors demonstrated the validity of this construct by testing whether their latent variable predicted three outcomes that learning engagement would be expected to predict controlling for three potential confounding variables -->

<!-- This is one of the most well cited empirical papers using SEM in ecology. It's interesting how little they show on the actual diagram, but rather show the coefficients for a huge number of responses. Question, which paths do these coefficients map onto?  -->

# Discussion
## What makes a good data visualization?

# Theory

*Maybe one slide drawing on theory from people like Edward Tufte*

*Information/ink ratio*

# What is a good SEM drawing


Discussion: 

Starting from what you draw and what you just saw, what is the minimum necessary information to include in an SEM?

What is missing in your drawing?


# Necessary information

There are no rules. Here are our guidelines to help drawing a good/reproducible/interpretable SEM diagram.


1) Represent your variables
1) Represent your coefficients
1) Represent all paths 
1) Report model goodness of fit
1) Report explanatory power for endogenous variables
1) Include important tables


# Necessary information
**1) Represent your variables**

Squares are data

Circles are latent variables

Hexagon (?) for composite variables

*insert illustration*

# Necessary information
**2) Represent your coefficients**

Magnitude, direction, and significance

- Change the path

Color for direction

Dashed vs solid for significance

- Change the size

Write the numbers

*insert illustration*

# Necessary information
**3) Represent all paths **

Represent causal paths included in your model regardless of significance. 
Not necessarily in the same figure.

Represent important correlations

- Exogenous can or can not be included
- Always include correlations among the errors of endogenous variables

# Necessary information
**4) Report model goodness of fit**

- Covariance-based approaches

Chi-squared

SRMR

RMSEA

- Local estimation

D-sep test

# Necessary information
**5) Explanatory power for endogenous variables**

Residual error or R2

# Necessary information
**6) Include important tables**

Coefficient table

Local estimation: basis set?

Mediation analysis?



# Room for artistry 

This will depend on the audience and support:

Is this a paper?

Is this a presentation?

What is the narrative structure?

Key thing here is that one structure might not work in every case.
Not advocating for anything in particular, but note that the same model for a paper might not be the right presentation for an SEM.


# Room for artistry

Interactions,multigroup models, composites, etc.

Color, size, etc.

Organizing variables in space in a way that is useful to your reader rather than distracting:

- Top to bottom, or left to right?
- Mediator relative placement

Composite variable: do we need to show everything?

Breaking up complicated models into several panels or several figures

Moving information to a supplement

# Room for artistry


Meta models, apriori models, etc

- Start with something abstract (metamodel concept)
- shows the core concepts and their relationships, ignoring the data.
- The most abstracted vision of the causal process you are trying to capture



# Room for artistry

Showing the underlying data

Partial plots

Raw correlations:

- Shows linearity assumption, shows distribution of data, etc
- Correlation tables



# Building the plot 

This can be done in R. But it is generally done in external software like powerpoint, illustrator, or Inkscape.

In R, it can be useful to visualise your code and your model output.
