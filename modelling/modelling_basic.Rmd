## What dataset to use, properties of data?

## LM 
- visualisation as DAG
- residuals
- variance/covariance matrix

## SEM, very simple example (same variables as in LM) 
- visualisation as DAG
- explain model output
- assessment of fit

## model comparison
- add an additional variable or path, then compare the two SEM

## SEM pruning (deleting paths)

## SEM with latent and composite variables
- difference between latent and composite variable
- SEM with latent variable(s)
- SEM with composite variable(s)

## SEM with autocorrelation (temporal, spatial) --> advanced?
