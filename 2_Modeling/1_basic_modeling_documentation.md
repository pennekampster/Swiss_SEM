## Model structure from workshop
The model structure as developped during the workshop (see figure below), proved to be unsatisfying as

1. the randomly selected year (2000) by chance fitted well. However, this was different for the single years (e.g. fitted: 1983, 1984 or 1991, failed: 1982 or 2004). All years combined failed the fit marginally. A common feature however, is the missing correlation between richness and evenness.
1. this may be due to my somewhat unfamiliarity with the topic, but I would expect disturbance to--at least potentially--also act on, besides biomass, richness and evenness.
1. However, if the paths from disturbance to biomass, richness and evenness is included, the model is saturated and barely is helpful for a modeling exercise.
