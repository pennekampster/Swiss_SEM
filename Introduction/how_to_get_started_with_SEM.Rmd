## What is a SEM?

Comments:
Each slide represents a concept/topic to teach. Can be expanded to more slides.
Content must be revisited to be consistent in wording, concepts etc.
Specially required feedback on causality, meta-model, backdoor criterion, loops.
Concepts for technical part that could be introduced also here: global vs local, information criteria for arrow selection (for me better on technical part).

## What is a SEM?

Here we ask students about what is a SEM, why they want to learn them etc.
Will set the baseline for the concepts will be later introduced and to measure the level of the students.

## Research questions

The importance of questions in science -> We are scientist and we try to explain the reality surrounding us.
In this course, the focus is in ecology and evolution.

## Example of the working system

Description of the study system where data come from.
Add some nice pictures.

## Question of interest

Present one research question based on the data.
This question only NEEDS to include 2 variables.
Ask students about how they would address this question.

## Graphical representation

Introduce the graphical model representation (X -> Y):
- Variables are nodes.
- Arrows are causal relationships.
Use the question in the previous part as example.

## Causality

The arrow mean causality.
Is it the case in science?
Explain the concept and discuss with students the topic.
Show the difference between direct effects and correlation together with the graphical representation

## Simple statistical model

Present the bivariate model.
Include the equation and a plot.
It is important that students understand that all they know can be defined with a graphical representation.

## Multivariate questions

Discuss with students other variables that may affect B.
Introduce a new variable and the question that it answers.
Show the graphical model (X1 -> Y, X2 -> Y).
Include the equation and the two partial plots.
Be clear this is a multiple regression model.

## Interaction questions (Moderation)

Present another question involving a new variable with an interactive effect (X3 -> (Y -> Z)).
Show the graphical representation.
Explanation of interactive effects.
Include partial plots to illustrate the interaction effect. 
Make clear that this is the same as an interaction in traditional regression models.

## Indirect effect (Mediation)

Present another question involving a new variable (X1 -> Y -> Z).
Show the graphical representation.
Explanation of indirect effects.
Include partial plots for both to illustrate the indirect effect. 

## Types of variables

Until now everything was about paths but modelling also involves variables.
Definition of composite variables + examples.
Definition of latent variables + examples.
Make clear the difference between both.

## System level approach

Show a very complex model including multiple types of variables, arrows (direct and correlations) for the study system.
The complex model is built based on submodels, each one addressing specific questions.
We need a framework to analyze this together -> SEM
Discuss about complexity in ecology and if SEM is useful to answer your questions ("We need to do things as simple as possible, but no simpler").

## Assumptions of SEM 

Assumptions common to any statistical analysis (normality, amount of data, experimental design...).
Assumptions specific to SEM (data in the same scale...).

## Thinking about the model

Which variables include in the model 
- Supported by theory.
- Ecologically meaningful.
- Garbage in - garbage out concept (both data quality and ecologically meaningful).

Setting arrow direction.
- Causal vs correlation.
- Support for both directions, how to proceed (loops).

Good practice: Table of causal relationships before analysis.

## Meta-model

Thinking about what is missing in the model, measurement errors etc.
Present the concept of meta-model and impications for research.
Include a graphical representation of the meta-model as what is missing in the model.

## Modelling philosophy 

Two approaches: from theory (hypothesis) to data (exploratories).
Show as a continuum between two extremes.
Importance of being aware about what the model is telling to us.
Finall discussion about what SEM provides and the importance of system thinking in ecology.
