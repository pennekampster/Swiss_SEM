## Data from Welk et al. (2014) Biotic Interactions Overrule Plant Responses to Climate, Depending on the Species' Biogeography

We downloaded the data from https://idata.idiv.de/ddm/Data/ShowData/18



```{r,  include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

# load data
raw_data <- read.table("/Users/eliane/Desktop/SEM_UZH/Swiss_SEM/data_preparation/18_4_data_Welk_etal_PlosOne.csv", sep=";", header=TRUE)




```



What dataset to use, properties of data?

Full model with reduction vs. fit the hypothesis
Garbage in garbage out (low data quality results in useless output)
hereby, illustrate technical details (variance/covariance matrix, residuals etc.)
visualize LM and SEM as DAGs to highlight their conceptual difference and the benefit  of SEM
Advanced topics
latent and composite variables
model comparison, evaluation (GOF etc.), interpretation and pruning
autocorrelation (temporal, spatial)

optional:
non-linear relationships
interactions
multigroup fitting
