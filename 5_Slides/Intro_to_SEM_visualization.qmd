## Exercise: Draw your idea

How would you draw your model for a manuscript?

::: notes
Alternative wording could be "How would you draw the model output for a manuscript"? 
:::


<!-- ## Theory -->

<!-- *Maybe one slide drawing on theory from people like Edward Tufte* -->
<!-- *Information/ink ratio* -->

<!-- - What is the important information to convey? -->
<!-- - Aim for high information-to-ink ratio. -->
<!-- - Display variables that are informative rather than distracting for reader. -->
<!-- - Simplify with multiple panels or figures. -->
<!-- - Reading direction: top to bottom, or left to right -->
<!-- - Moving information to a supplement -->
<!-- - Use colours that work for colour-blind people -->

##  What is a good SEM drawing? 

::: {.incremental}
1) Show all relevant variables  
1) Show all relevant paths 
1) Report goodness of fit of the model 
1) Report explanatory power for endogenous variables  
1) Include figure or tables with additional quantities (e.g, indirect and total effects)

## Figures with additional quantities 

- Plots to show derived quantities such as direct, indirect and total effects

![](images/Duffy_derived.jpg){.absolute .absolute width="800"}

## Tables with coefficients (appendix)

- Report standardized and unstandardized effects
- Consider naming parameters for easier interpretation

![](images/path_coeff_table.png){.absolute .absolute width="400"}

## Raw data (appendix)

- Show the underlying data:
  - Plots of raw correlations
  - Correlation tables
  - Distributions of raw data
  - Partial plots

## Plotting tools

- Dedicated packages available in R 

## Plotting tools I: lavaanPlot package 

```{r echo=F, results='hide'}
library("lavaanPlot")
library(semPlot)
library(lavaan)
library(tidyverse)
library(here)


seabloom <- read.table(here("2_Modeling/Data_preparation/seabloom-2020-ele-dryad-data/cdr-e001-e002-output-data.csv"),
                       sep = ",", header = TRUE)
seabloom <- seabloom %>% group_by(exp, field, plot, disk, yr.plowed, ntrt, nadd, other.add) %>% summarise(across(mass.above:ens.pie, mean))
seabloom$mass.above <- seabloom$mass.above / 100


prune <-
'mass.above ~ nadd + rich + even + disk
rich ~ nadd 
even ~ nadd

rich ~~ even'

fit.prune <- sem(prune, data = seabloom, estimator = "MLM")
summary(fit.prune)
```


```{r echo=T, out.height = '5in'}

lavaanPlot(model = fit.prune,
           node_options = list(shape = "box", color = "gray",
                               fontname = "Helvetica"),
           edge_options = list(color = "black"),
           coefs = TRUE, covs = FALSE, stars = "regress")
```

::: incremental
- Allow for customization but may not provide full freedom
- Allow to export to png or pdf
- Caveat: interactions or multi-group models not supported yet
:::

## Plotting tools II: semPlot package

```{r echo=T}
semPaths(fit.prune, what = "est", whatLabels = "est",
         residuals = FALSE, intercepts = FALSE,
         sizeMan = 10, sizeMan2 = 7, edge.label.cex = 1,
         fade = FALSE, layout = "tree", style = "mx", nCharNodes = 0,
         posCol = "#009e73ff", negCol = "#d55e00ff", edge.label.color = "black",
         layoutSplit = TRUE, curve = 1, curvature = 1, #fixedStyle = 1,
         exoCov = FALSE, rotation = 1)
```

::: incremental
- Allow for customization but may not provide full freedom
- Rather rigid layout of plots (required in some fields)
:::


## Plotting tools

- Good for quick visualization but not ready for publication.
- Fine-tuning in external software like powerpoint, illustrator, or Inkscape often needed.


## Room for creativity 

Will depend on the audience and the purpose

. . .

  - Is this a paper?
  - Is this a presentation?
  - What is the narrative structure?

. . .

Design the figure accordingly! 

## Room for creativity {.smaller}

- Combine meta-model with fitted SEM

## A quick tour of SEM visualizations

Four SEMs across treatments.

::: {.column-page}
![](images/Hodapp_sem.jpg)
:::

::: notes
This figure does not show a multi-group model. Each treatment was modeled independently. Question: Is it appropriate to compare standardized coefficients between models with different datasets? In other words is the .53 in panel A the same as .53 in panel B?

::: {.column-page}
![](images/Allen_sem.jpg)
:::

::: notes
This is one of the most well cited empirical papers using SEM in ecology. It's interesting how little they show on the actual diagram, but rather show the coefficients for a huge number of responses. Question, which paths do these coefficients map onto?
:::

::: notes
Lots of exogenous variables. red = negative, black = positive. no non-significant paths?

Use of color to highlight important paths.

## A quick tour of SEM visualizations

![](images/Domeignoz-Horta_sem.jpg){.absolute .absolute width="800" right=100}

::: notes
There is a lot of information, including path coefficients, r2, goodness of fit. path width represents p-value, which is unusual. Where are the non-significant paths? Also, notice how low some of the R2 values are

## A quick tour of SEM visualizations

![](images/Jones_sem.jpg){.absolute .absolute width="700" right=200}

::: notes
Lots of information. The gray, solid line is "marginally significant" (0.1 > p > 0.05)
:::

![](images/Poorter_sem.jpg){.absolute .absolute width="700" right=200}

::: notes
Use of color. Showing a conceptual model in the same figure as the data-model. Unusual way of showing a composite.

::: notes
Unclear from the paper whether this is a multigroup model or four separate models. my intuition says it's four separate models

I like the use of color here, but why does it go from bottom to top?

## A quick tour of SEM visualizations

![](images/Tabi_SEM.png){.absolute .absolute width="900" right=100}

::: notes
Very high data-to-information ratio. this is a multi-group model. I like the way they show significance of paths and errors on the path coefficient estimates. They de-emphasize metrics like p-values in doing so.
