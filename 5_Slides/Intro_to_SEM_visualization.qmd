<!-- ## Theory -->

<!-- *Maybe one slide drawing on theory from people like Edward Tufte* -->
<!-- *Information/ink ratio* -->

<!-- - What is the important information to convey? -->
<!-- - Aim for high information-to-ink ratio. -->
<!-- - Display variables that are informative rather than distracting for reader. -->
<!-- - Simplify with multiple panels or figures. -->
<!-- - Reading direction: top to bottom, or left to right -->
<!-- - Moving information to a supplement -->
<!-- - Use colours that work for colour-blind people -->

The strength of direct and indirect land-use effects on ecosystem multifunctionality. The index of multifunctionality was calculated for five scenarios, representing different land-use objectives (Fig. 1), and three regions. The structural equation model used to calculate the indirect effects (a) through changing species richness and (e) through changing specific leaf area (SLA). Indirect effects could be mediated through changing species richness (b–d) or through changes to the community weighted mean (CWM) of SLA (f–h). The best explanation for the indirect effects (either SLA or species richness) for each region is shown by an asterisk (*) (see, Methods and Table S3). Indirect effects are calculated by multiplying the path coefficient for the effect of land-use intensity (LUI) on species richness/SLA with the path coefficient for the effect of species richness/SLA on multifunctionality, see Table S4 for the individual path coefficients.

Structural equation models for total nitrogen (N) fit to subestuaries and their watersheds by salinity zone. (A) Tidal freshwater/oligohaline (0–5 psu), (B) mesohaline (5–15 psu), and (C) polyhaline (15–25 psu). Arrow width is proportional to the standardized effect size, given next to the arrows. Black arrows denote positive effects; red arrows, negative effects. Nonsignificant relationships (P > 0.05) have been omitted for clarity, including the nonsignificant effects of point source nutrients and total suspended solids (TSS) (SI Appendix, Fig. S5). Map Insets denote the location of watersheds. Units and unstandardized path coefficients are given in SI Appendix, Supplementary Materials.

Four SEMs across treatments.

::: notes
This figure does not show a multi-group model. Each treatment was modeled independently. Question: Is it appropriate to compare standardized coefficients between models with different datasets? In other words is the .53 in panel A the same as .53 in panel B?

::: notes
There is a lot of information, including path coefficients, r2, goodness of fit. path width represents p-value, which is unusual. Where are the non-significant paths? Also, notice how low some of the R2 values are

Unclear from the paper whether this is a multigroup model or four separate models. my intuition says it's four separate models

Structural Equation Modelling standardised results showing how planted or sown species richness (Sp. richness) affected the observed CV (coefficient of variation of community biomass, Obs. CV) through each of the six components of our prediction (Fig. 2). Sync: synchrony of species environmental responses ue; env var: mean scaled environmental variance R2  e ; com bio: mean community biomass NT ; dem var: mean scaled demographic variance R2  d; Simp: Simpson’s (1949)  concentration index, k; obs var: mean observation variance R2  o.

::: notes
Very high data-to-information ratio. this is a multi-group model. I like the way they show significance of paths and errors on the path coefficient estimates. They de-emphasize metrics like p-values in doing so.

The causal network based on structural equations. The path coefficients are shown in the small inset plots, with the different temperature regimes (groups) shown with different colours (constant = blue, slow = yellow, linear = orange, fast = red). The error bars indicate the standard error of the estimate. The temperature effect was fixed to zero for the constant treatment (hence no error bars). Dashed arrows indicate predominantly negative effects, while solid arrows indicate a positive effects across temperature change. Grey arrows indicate a switch of sign in the coefficients across treatments

##  What is a good SEM drawing? 

::: {.incremental}
1) Show relevant variables and paths
1) Indicate path coefficients (direction, magnitude, significance)
1) Show constructs with appropriate complexity 
1) Report goodness-of-fit of the model 
1) Report explanatory power for endogenous variables  
1) Add graphs or tables with additional quantities (e.g, indirect and total effects) when relevant  
:::

## Relevant variables and their types

## Path coefficients  {.smaller}


::: {.incremental}
- Indicate the direction, and significance by:   
  - Arrow width for magnitude
  - Add coefficients when possible  
  - Linetype or color for direction   
  - Dashed vs solid for significance

## Figures with additional quantities 

- Plots to show derived quantities such as direct, indirect and total effects

![](images/Duffy_derived.jpg){.absolute .absolute width="800"}

## Tables with coefficients (appendix)

- Report standardized and unstandardized effects
- Consider naming parameters for easier interpretation

## Raw data (appendix)

- Show the underlying data:
  - Plots of raw correlations
  - Partial plots

## Plotting tools

- Dedicated packages available in R 

## Plotting tools I: lavaanPlot package 

```{r echo=F, results='hide'}
library("lavaanPlot")
library(semPlot)
library(lavaan)
library(tidyverse)
library(here)


seabloom <- read.table(here("2_Modeling/Data_preparation/seabloom-2020-ele-dryad-data/cdr-e001-e002-output-data.csv"),
                       sep = ",", header = TRUE)
seabloom <- seabloom %>% group_by(exp, field, plot, disk, yr.plowed, ntrt, nadd, other.add) %>% summarise(across(mass.above:ens.pie, mean))
seabloom$mass.above <- seabloom$mass.above / 100


prune <-
'mass.above ~ nadd + rich + even + disk
rich ~ nadd 
even ~ nadd

rich ~~ even'

fit.prune <- sem(prune, data = seabloom, estimator = "MLM")
summary(fit.prune)
```


```{r echo=T, out.height = '5in'}

lavaanPlot(model = fit.prune,
           node_options = list(shape = "box", color = "gray",
                               fontname = "Helvetica"),
           edge_options = list(color = "black"),
           coefs = TRUE, covs = FALSE, stars = "regress")
```

::: incremental
- Allows for customization but does not provide full freedom
- Allows to export to png or pdf
- Interactions or multi-group models currently not supported.
  - Workaround: fit separate models with fixed parameters. 
:::

## Plotting tools II: semPlot package

```{r echo=T}
semPaths(fit.prune, what = "est", whatLabels = "est",
         residuals = FALSE, intercepts = FALSE,
         sizeMan = 10, sizeMan2 = 7, edge.label.cex = 1,
         fade = FALSE, layout = "tree", style = "mx", nCharNodes = 0,
         posCol = "#009e73ff", negCol = "#d55e00ff", edge.label.color = "black",
         layoutSplit = TRUE, curve = 1, curvature = 1, #fixedStyle = 1,
         exoCov = FALSE, rotation = 1)
```

::: incremental
- Follows field specific conventions (e.g., psychology, social sciences)
- Therefore rather rigid layout 
- Allows for customization with semptools package
:::


## Plotting tools: conclusion 

- Sufficient for visualizing SEM outputs but not ready for publication.
- Fine-tuning in external software like powerpoint, illustrator, or Inkscape needed.


## Room for creativity 

Will depend on the audience and the purpose

. . .

  - Is this a paper?
  - Is this a presentation?
  - What is the narrative structure?

. . .

Design the figure accordingly! 

## Room for creativity {.smaller}

- Combine meta-model with fitted SEM
