## Exercise: Draw your idea

How would you draw your model for a manuscript?

::: notes
Alternative wording could be "How would you draw the model output for a manuscript"? 
That might create more variation which would be kind of fun
:::


## What can you expect to see out in nature?

Four SEMs across treatments.

::: {.column-page}
![](images/Hodapp_sem.jpg)
:::

::: notes
This figure does not show a multi-group model. Each treatment was modeled independently. Question: Is it appropriate to compare standardized coefficients between models with different datasets? In other words is the .53 in panel A the same as .53 in panel B?

::: notes
This is one of the most well cited empirical papers using SEM in ecology. It's interesting how little they show on the actual diagram, but rather show the coefficients for a huge number of responses. Question, which paths do these coefficients map onto?
:::

## What can you expect to see out in nature?

![](images/Duffy_sem.png){.absolute .absolute width="600" right=200}


::: notes
Lots of exogenous variables. red = negative, black = positive. no non-significant paths?
:::


## What can you expect to see out in nature?

![](images/Domeignoz-Horta_sem.jpg){.absolute .absolute width="800" right=100}

::: notes
There is a lot of information, including path coefficients, r2, goodness of fit. path width represents p-value, which is unusual. Where are the non-significant paths? Also, notice how low some of the R2 values are

Use of color to highlight important paths.

## What can you expect to see out in nature?

![](images/Jones_sem.jpg){.absolute .absolute width="700" right=200}

::: notes
Lots of information. The gray, solid line is "marginally significant" (0.1 > p > 0.05)
:::

## What can you expect to see out in nature?

![](images/Poorter_sem.jpg){.absolute .absolute width="700" right=200}

::: notes
Use of color. Showing a conceptual model in the same figure as the data-model. Unusual way of showing a composite.
::: 


## What can you expect to see out in nature?

![](images/Mazancourt_sem.jpg){.absolute .absolute width="700" right=200}

::: notes
Unclear from the paper whether this is a multigroup model or four separate models. my intuition says it's four separate models
:::

## What can you expect to see out in nature?

![](images/Mazziotta_sem.jpg){.absolute .absolute width="1000" right=0}

::: notes
I like the use of color here, but why does it go from bottom to top?
:::

## What can you expect to see out in nature?

![](images/Tabi_SEM.png){.absolute .absolute width="900" right=100}

::: notes
Very high data-to-information ratio. this is a multi-group model. I like the way they show significance of paths and errors on the path coefficient estimates. They de-emphasize metrics like p-values in doing so.

# What makes a good data visualization?

<!-- ## Theory -->

<!-- *Maybe one slide drawing on theory from people like Edward Tufte* -->
<!-- *Information/ink ratio* -->

<!-- - What is the important information to convey? -->
<!-- - Aim for high information-to-ink ratio. -->
<!-- - Display variables that are informative rather than distracting for reader. -->
<!-- - Simplify with multiple panels or figures. -->
<!-- - Reading direction: top to bottom, or left to right -->
<!-- - Moving information to a supplement -->
<!-- - Use colours that work for colour-blind people -->

## What is a good SEM drawing?

::: {.incremental}
- Starting from your drawing and what you just saw, what is missing in your drawing?
- What is the minimum necessary information to include in an SEM?   
:::

##  What is a good SEM drawing? {.smaller}

Guidelines to help drawing an informative, interpretable and reproducible SEM diagrams.

::: {.incremental}
1) Show the relevant variables  
1) Represent causal relationships by the path coefficients  
1) Represent all relevant paths (regardless of significance)   
1) Report goodness of fit of the model 
1) Report explanatory power for endogenous variables  
1) Include tables with additional coefficients and derived quantities  
:::

## Show the relevant variables 

::: {.incremental}
:::::::::::::: {.columns}
::: {.column}
- Squares for measured variables  
- Ellipses for latent variables   
- Hexagons for composite variables 
:::
::: {.column}
![](images/Jones_sem.jpg){height=80%}
:::
::::::::::::::
:::

## Represent causal relationships by the path coefficients  {.smaller}

::: {.incremental}
:::::::::::::: {.columns}
::: {.column}
- Indicate the magnitude, direction, and significance by:   
  - Linetype or color for direction   
  - Dashed vs solid for significance   
  - Arrow width for magnitude   
  - Labelling with coefficient (in simple diagrams)

## Represent all relevant paths (regardless of significance) {.smaller}

::: {.incremental}
:::::::::::::: {.columns}
::: {.column}
- Represent all causal paths included in your model regardless of significance. 
- Not necessarily in the same figure.
- Represent important correlations.
- Exogenous variables can be included.
- Always include correlations among the errors of endogenous variables.

## Report model goodness of fit

::: {.incremental}
:::::::::::::: {.columns}
::: {.column}
- Covariance-based approaches:
  - $\chi^2$  
  - CFI  
  - SRMR  
  - RMSEA

::: {.column}
- Residual error or $R^2$

## Include tables with additional coefficients and derived quantities 

::: {.incremental}
:::::::::::::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
Table of path coefficients:

## Data presentation

::: {.incremental}
- Show the underlying data:
  - Plots of raw correlations
  - Correlation tables
  - Distributions of raw data
  - Partial plots
:::

## Room for artistry 

::: {.incremental}
- This will depend on the audience and the purpose:
  - Is this a paper?
  - Is this a presentation?
  - What is the narrative structure?
:::

. . .

Design the figure accordingly! 


## Room for artistry {.smaller}

- Meta models:
  - Shows the core concepts and their relationships, ignoring the data.
  - The most conceptual version of the causal network you try to capture.

## Plotting tools

- Dedicated packages available in R (e.g., semPlot, lavaanPlot)
- Fine-tuning in external software like powerpoint, illustrator, or Inkscape often needed.
