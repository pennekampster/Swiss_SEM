# Getting started with Structural Equation Modeling

## Understanding (ecological) systems {.smaller}

<!-- Comments: -->

<!-- Each slide represents a concept/topic to teach. Can be expanded to more slides. -->

<!-- Content must be revisited to be consistent in wording, concepts etc. -->

<!-- Specially required feedback on causality, meta-model, backdoor criterion, loops. -->

<!-- Concepts for technical part that could be introduced also here: global vs local, information criteria for arrow selection (for me better on technical part). -->

::: {.incremental}
::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
-   Ecological systems characterized by complex network of interactions between organisms and the environment.
-   Research questions are often about cause-effect relationships.
-   Create hypotheses about how things could be connected in ecological systems (e.g., species interactions, drivers). 
-   Test these hypotheses using data and statistics.

## Why is understanding causes important? {.smaller}

::: {.incremental}
::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
- Causes = mechanisms
  + Allows us to predict the behaviour of a system
  + Justify interventions (e.g., eradication of invasive species, habitat restoration for threatened species)
- What is the problem?
  + Confounding of cause with non-cause (e.g., avoid interventions with no or detrimental effects)

## Causality

> "Correlation does not imply causation"

::: {.incremental}
::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
- Causation: causing variation in X leading to variation in Y (=X causes Y), everything else being equal.
- Experiments required to isolate effect of X on Y.
- Randomized controlled trials as gold standard to infer causes
- Problem: conducting experiments can be unethical or unfeasible.

## "Correlation can indicate causation" 


> A simple correlation implies an unresolved causal structure, since we cannot know which is the cause, which is the effect, or even if both are common effects of some third, unmeasured variable.    
Bill Shipley (Cause and correlation in biology, 2004)

::: {.incremental}
::: columns
::: {.column width="100%"}
- Inferring causes from observations is possible, but requires well justified assumptions.
- Necessary to rule out confounding (i.e., backdoor paths).

## How can we determine causality? 
> The combination of knowledge of correlations with knowledge of causal relations, to obtain certain results, is a different thing from the deduction of causal relations from correlations.”    
Sewell Wright, 1923

## Causal diagram

::: {.incremental}
-   Graph specifying putative cause-effect relationships.
-   Data-generating mechanisms lead to a set of observational expectations.
-   Causal diagrams are based on directed acyclic graphs (DAGs).
:::

## Directed acyclic graphs {.smaller}

::: {.incremental}
::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
- Directed = unidirectional. 
- Acyclic = no cylces (=causal loops) permitted.
- Variables are nodes (boxes). 
- Edges (one-headed arrows) are causal relationships such as X affects Y.  
- Edges can have any functional shape. 
- Omitted links and nodes have empirical implications (= assumptions about the causal diagram)
- U variables represent unmeasured causes.

## Motivations to use SEM:

::: {.incremental}
1) Driver-focused: Understand how drivers influence a system 
2) Response-focused: Understand and explain a particular response of a system  
3) Mediation-focused: Understand underlying causal pathways  
4) Theory-focused: compare observations of a system to available theory 
::: 

## SEM modelling philosophy

::: {.incremental}
- A SEM should be specified based on prior evidence / theory (i.e., a meta-model).
- Each path requires justification.
- Continuum between theory (hypothesis-driven) to exploratory (data-driven) modelling.
- Causal diagram to specify relationships of actual variables (using meta-model).

# Questions?

## Exercise

-   Your turn!
-   What type is your SEM (response, driver, mediation, theory focused)?
-   Draw a causal diagram of the dataset you want to understand (define nodes and edges).
-   Make a table with putative causal relationships.



# SEM model fitting

## How to estimate SEMs? 

::: {.incremental}
- Structural equation modelling is a framework rather than a statistical technique.   
- Lavaan uses Maximum likelihood estimation (ML).   
- Important: only variance-covariance matrix used for global estimation of SEM.    
:::

# Global estimation in a nutshell

## Observed variables

```{r, out.width="90%", fig.align='center'}
set.seed(5)
x <- rnorm(500, sd=runif(500, 2, 50))
x2 <- 0.5 *x + rnorm(500, sd=runif(500, 2, 50))
d <- matrix(c(x,x2), 250)
colnames(d) <-   c("X1","X2", "X3", "Y")

panel_regression_line = function(x,y, ...){
  points(x,y,...)
  linear_regression = lm(y~x)
  linear_regression_line = abline(linear_regression)
}


pairs(d, pch = 19, lower.panel=panel_regression_line, upper.panel = panel_regression_line)
```

Scatter plots of observed variables and fitted lines.   


## Variance-covariance matrix estimated from data {.smaller}

```{r}
set.seed(5)
x <- rnorm(500, sd=runif(500, 2, 50))
x2 <- 0.5 *x + rnorm(500, sd=runif(500, 2, 50))
d <- matrix(c(x,x2), 250)
V <- cov(d)
colnames(V)  <- c("X1","X2", "X3", "Y")
rownames(V)  <- c("X","X2", "X3", "Y")
kable(V)
```

-   Variances on the diagonal, covariances on the off-diagonal elements

. . .

-   Variance: $VAR_{x}=\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{N}(x_{i}-\bar{x})^2}{N-1}$
    -   Variance is the degree of spread in a set of data.

. . .

-   Covariance: $COV_{x,y}=\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{N}(x_{i}-\bar{x})(y_{i}-\bar{y})}{N-1}$
    -   Covariance measures how much two variables are moving together.

## Correlation matrix estimated from data {.smaller}

```{r}
set.seed(5)
x <- rnorm(500, sd=runif(500, 2, 50))
x2 <- 0.5 *x + rnorm(500, sd=runif(500, 2, 50))
d <- matrix(c(x,x2), 250)
V <- cov(d)
colnames(V)  <- c("X1","X2", "X3", "Y")
rownames(V)  <- c("X","X2", "X3", "Y")
kable(cov2cor(V))
```

- Correlation: $COR_{x,y}=\frac{COV_{x,y}}{\sigma_x*\sigma_y}$
  + Correlation matrix is standardized variance-covariance matrix

## Rule 4 {.smaller}

> When variables are connected by more than one pathway, each pathway is the 'partial' regression coefficient.

::: {.incremental}
-   The partial regression coefficient accounts for influence of more than one variable on the response\
-   In other words, the coefficient for one predictor controls for the influence of other predictors in the model\
-   The coefficients of multiple regression are partial coefficients

## Rule 5 {.smaller}

> Errors on endogenous variables relate the unexplained correlations or variances arising from unmeasured variables.

::: {.incremental}
-   $R^{2}$: ratio of explained to total variation in response (here Y1)\
-   Unexplained or residual variance = $1 - R^{2}$
-   Captures other (unknown) sources causing correlation between Y1 and other variables to deviate from 1.
-   In a path diagram, error variances are often represented as $\zeta$ with an arrow leading into the endogenous variable.

## Rule 6 {.smaller}

> Unanalyzed (residual) correlations among two endogenous variables are their partial correlations.

::: {.incremental}
-   If they were exogenous variables, the relationship would be their bivariate correlation (Rule #1).
-   Here we have we have to remove the effects of X on both variables.
-   These are known as correlated errors and represented by double-headed arrows between the errors of two endogenous variables.

## Unstandardized vs standardized coefficients

::: incremental
- Global estimation based on covariance / correlation matrices.
- Results in unstandardized / standardized coefficients.
- Significance tests on unstandardized (raw) coefficients.
- Standardized coefficients for interpretation only (relative strength of paths).
- Only allow for comparisons within the same dataset.
:::

::: aside
$r_{xy} = \frac{cov_{xy}}{SD_x \times SD_y}$
where $r_{xy}$ are the correlations, $cov_{xy}$ the covariances and $SD_x$ and $SD_y$ the respective standard deviations (the square roots of the respective variance $= \sqrt{var_x}$ and $= \sqrt{var_y}$)
:::


## Assumptions of SEM with lavaan

::: {.incremental}
-   (Multivariate) normality of endogenous (but not exogenous!) variables required
-   Global estimation based on variance-covariance matrix
-   Directed (acyclic) relationships
-   Linear relationships
::: 

# Model evaluation

## Model fit measures {.smaller}

+ *$\chi^2$ statistic*
  - compare the model-implied to the observed variance-covariance
  - good fit when $\chi^2$ statistic is small (P > 0.05)   
  - sample-size dependent

. . .

+ *Comparative fit index (CFI)*: 
  - deviation from a 'null' model (variances estimated but covariances set to 0).
  - higher is better, \> 0.95 is considered good.

. . .

+ *Root-mean squared error of approximation (RMSEA)*
  - statistic penalizes models based on sample size
  - \< 0.10 is acceptable, and anything \< 0.06 is good

. . .

+ *Standardized root-mean squared residual (SRMR)*
  - standardized difference between the observed and predicted correlations
  - \< 0.08 is considered good

## Troubleshooting pathological models (a.k.a. Heywood cases)

-   Improper solutions:
    -   Negative variances
    -   Correlations larger than 1

. . .

-   Reasons for the warnings can be:
    1)  Slightly negative error estimates (not really a problem)\
    2)  Indicators for latent variables need to be positively correlated\
    3)  Local non-identification of parameters\
    4)  Model misspecification

## Parameter identification

::: {.incremental}
- Identifiability is a common issue in SEM
- Some of the free parameters you are trying to estimate are interchangeable (e.g., a and b in `y = a*x + b*x + c`)
- High correlation of parameters indicates identifiability issues.
- Even an infinite amount of data does not allow to identify parameters precisely (e.g. one could be high the other low or vice-versa)
- The more complex a SEM is, the more likely issues of identifiability will become
- Fixing parameters or their variance may be needed to achieve model convergence (especially when latents or composites are involved).
::: 


## Model identification

::: {.incremental}
-   Underidentified: not enough pieces of information to identify parameters uniquely (df \< 0).\
-   Saturated: Just enough information to uniquely identify parameters, but no df to check model fit (df = 0).\
-   Over-identified: parameters can be uniquely identified and positive dfs to test model goodness-of-fit (df \> 0).
:::

## Model identification

"t-rule" to quickly gauge whether a model is under-, just, or overidentified:

$$ t \leq \frac{n (n + 1 )}{2} $$

*t* = number of unknowns (parameters to be estimated, i.e. variances & covariances)\
*n* = number of knowns (observed variables).

The LHS is how many pieces of information we want to know.\
RHS: information we have (number of unique cells in the observed variance-covariance matrix).

## Variable types: continuous

::: {.incremental}
  - Exogenous variables:
    - No limitations, can be used as endo- and exogenous variables
  - Endogenous variables:
    - lavaan can only handle Gaussian error distribution; for other error distributions consider piecewiseSEM package.
:::

## Variable types: categorical
::: {.incremental}

<!-- https://personality-project.org/r/tutorials/summerschool.14/rosseel_sem_cat.pdf 

https://www.aggieerin.com/post/quick-and-dirty-categorical-lavaan/

-->

- Includes binary (yes/no, failure/success, etc.), nominal (site 1, site 2), or ordinal levels (small < medium < large) variables.
  - nominal variables currently not covered by lavaan
- Exogenous variables:
  - code binary variables as dummy variable (0/1)
  - if more than 2 levels, create multiple dummy variables
- Endogenous variables:
  - for binary and ordinal variables, use R's `ordered()` function to specify the order, or use `ordered=` argument.
  - when `ordered=` argument is used, WLSMV estimator is used by lavaan.
- Bootstrapping approach to get robust standard error estimates due to non-normal errors when dealing with categorical variables.
:::



## Data requirements

::: {.incremental}
-   Replication should be at least 5x the number of estimated coefficients (not error variances or other correlations).
-   To estimate two relationships, at least n = 10 required to fit model.
-   Ideally, replication is 5-20x the number of estimated parameters.
-   The larger the sample size, the more precise (unbiased) are the estimates.
:::

## SEM check list {.smaller}

1)  Review the relevant theory and research literature to support model specification
2)  Specify a model (e.g., using causal diagram)
3)  Determine model identification
4)  Select measurements for the variables represented in the model
5)  Collect data
6)  Conduct preliminary descriptive statistical analysis (e.g., scaling, missing data, collinearity issues, outlier detection)
7)  Fit SEM
8)  Assess model goodness-of-fit
9) Check for missing or unnecessary links
10) Interpret model coefficients
11) Present results visually

<!-- ## Basic lavaan syntax

Define model:

```r
mod.form  <-
"Y ~ X1 + X2 + x3
X3 ~ X1

1)  How has aboveground biomass changed as a function of soil disturbance and nutrient addition?
2)  How are these effects mediated by biodiversity?

::: {.incremental}
1)  Function (biomass) is directly influenced by the environment (nutrients, disturbance)
2)  Function (biomass) is directly influenced by biodiversity (richness and evenness).
3)  The environment also influences biodiversity and thus, have an indirect effect on function via biodiversity.

## Exercise 1 

- Load and aggregate the Seabloom dataset (data and code provided)
- Check collinearity of the following variables:
  - nadd, disk, nadd, rich, even, ens.pie, mass.above
- Check multivariate normality of the following variables: 
 - rich, even, mass.above
- Fit multiple linear regression models to estimate coefficients
    -   direct effects of environmental predictors on above ground biomass (AGB)
    -   (in)direct effects of environmental predictors on richness and evenness
- What do you conclude?

## Exercise 2

```{dot}
//| fig-width: 10

    evenness->biomass ;
    richness->biomass ;
  
 { rank="same"; nutrients; disturbance}
 { rank="same"; evenness; richness}
}
```

-   Fit the above DAG to the Seabloom data:
    -   Assess model goodness of fit.
    -   Investigate the modification indices. Any paths that need adding?
    -   Check model summary.
- What do you conclude?

## Exercise 3 

```{dot}
//| fig-width: 10
//| fig-height: 4
digraph  {

   # a 'graph' statement
  graph [overlap = false, fontsize = 10, rankdir = LR, ranksep=1]

  # several 'node' statements
  node [shape = box,
        fontname = Helvetica, color="gray"]
  
        evenness, richness;
        nutrients;
        disturbance;

    nutrients->richness;

    nutrients -> biomass;
    disturbance -> biomass;

    evenness:e-> richness:e [dir=both; minlen=3, style="dashed"] ;

    evenness->biomass ;
    richness->biomass ;
  
 { rank="same"; nutrients; disturbance}
 { rank="same"; evenness; richness}
}
```


After finding a model with good fit:

-   Model analysis:
    -   Calculate the standardized coefficients.
    -   Add derived quantities (direct and indirect effects of nutrients on biomass).

## Exercise 4 


```{dot}
//| fig-width: 10
//| fig-height: 4

digraph  {

   # a 'graph' statement
  graph [overlap = false, fontsize = 10, rankdir = LR, ranksep=1]

  # several 'node' statements
  node [shape = box,
        fontname = Helvetica, color="gray"]
  
        evenness, richness;
        nutrients;
        disturbance;

    disturbance->richness;
    disturbance->evenness;
    nutrients->richness;
    nutrients->evenness;
    nutrients->biomass;
    disturbance -> biomass;

    evenness:e-> richness:e [dir=both; minlen=3, style="dashed"] ;

    evenness->biomass ;
    richness->biomass ;
  
 { rank="same"; nutrients; disturbance}
 { rank="same"; evenness; richness}
}
```

-   Saturated model:
    -   Model comparison with simpler model used in exercise 3.
    -   Perform model pruning.
    -   Decide on most parsimonious model and summarize model.
- What do you conclude?

## Exercise 5 

```{dot}
//| fig-width: 10
//| fig-height: 4

digraph  {

   # a 'graph' statement
  graph [overlap = false, fontsize = 10, rankdir = LR, ranksep=1]

  # several 'node' statements
  node [shape = box,
        fontname = Helvetica, color="gray"]
  
        evenness, richness;
        nutrients;
        disturbance;

    disturbance->richness [color="red"];
    disturbance->evenness [color="red"];
    nutrients->richness;
    nutrients->evenness;
    disturbance -> biomass [color="red"];

    evenness:e-> richness:e [dir=both; minlen=3; style="dashed"];

    evenness->biomass ;
    richness->biomass ;
  
 { rank="same"; nutrients; disturbance}
 { rank="same"; evenness; richness}
}
```

-   Perform mediation analysis:
    -   Is there no, partial, or full mediation of disturbance on biomass via richness and eveness?
    -   Add paths from disturbance to richness and evenness, remove the direct paths to AGB (both nutrients and disturbance).
    -   Compare model fit to simple model. 
- What do you conclude?
